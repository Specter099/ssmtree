## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Specter099/ssmtree/security/advisories) to report vulnerabilities privately:

1. Go to the repository's **Settings > Security > Advisories**
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Fill in the details of the vulnerability

This ensures the issue is handled privately until a fix is available.

## What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours of your report
- **Status update** within 7 days with an assessment and expected timeline
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue before any public disclosure

## Scope

**In scope:**

- ssmtree CLI code
- Project dependencies
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

**Out of scope:**

- AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store service itself (report directly to [AWS Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/))
